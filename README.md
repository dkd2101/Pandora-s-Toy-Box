# Pandora's Toy Box
TEAM 21 - Climate Change Project (Immersive Story-narrated Interactive VR Game)
An interactive VR experience created for the 2022 MIT Reality Hack (Semi-finalist)

## Why'd we make this?
How could one small action affect the world around us? This is the idea we aimed to convey using the immersice medium of VR. One by one as we perform an action, we can see the effects that it has on our environment if everyone were to do the same, showing how something seemingly small can build into somehting much bigger

## What'd I learn?
As the sole developer of the project I learned a lot about debugging and troubleshooting VR interactions using Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit. I also taught myself how to build and playtest in an Oculus Quest 2 headset. I was in charge of interaction design and implementation on this project so I learned a lot about the particle system in Unity and figuring out how to make the user feel a sense of satisfaction when throwing and releasing actions into the air.
